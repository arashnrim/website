    Iâ€™m currently a student undergoing studies in information technology at a
    polytechnic in Singapore. I love playing around with code and raging at
    random and obscure errors. When I'm not coding, I'm probably resting somehow
    or enjoying the moment with friends and family.

    My journey in code began in 2019 (<span id="wall__time">a few</span> years ago!)
    when I was introduced to programming with an Arduino. While I remain <i

    about hardware in general, learning more about it from no prior background set
    the wheels in motion that led to me exploring programming. Jump cut to now and
    I'm hoping to pursue programming as a career! I'm currently exploring front-end
    development in greater detail, exploring frameworks, tools, and libraries as
    I go.

    Something new that I'm so passionate about exploring is the community behind
    programming. I've had the opportunity to get to meet amazing people in the
    community and I'm so grateful for that. I hope to pay things forward, be it
    planning events or giving advice with what little I've learnt. I recently
    helped organise workshops for <a

      >a 42-hour hackathon for teenagers in New Delhi</a
    >; and that's a big step for me!
