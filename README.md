# website

Welcome to [my website](https://arash.codes)'s repository! This is the fourth iteration of my personal website, and it's built with [Astro](https://astro.build). This version is a complete rewrite of the previous version, which was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Motivations

Having a website of my own meant that I had a little space on the internet that I could call my own. I would be able to share more with prospective connections about myself all while learning by doing. Instead of relying on learning platforms to be walked through overly-simplified projects, I wanted to engage myself with a practical product â€” in this case, being able to share more about myself.

A particularly interesting decision for this iteration was to manually write the stylesheets in plain CSS. This proved to be a great learning experience, picking up more about vanilla CSS and how to structure it in a maintainable way. I previously used Tailwind CSS for my website, but I wanted to try something different this time around.
